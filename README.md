# AVD Quickstart Containerlab

> **WARNING**
> This repository is still under construction. It's fully functional, but has number of limitations.
> For example:
> - README is still work-in-progress
> - Lab configuration and adresses are hardcoded and have to be redefined in many different files if you setup is different. That will be simplified before the final release.
> - Some workflow and code optimization required.

The lab can be used together with CVP VM deployed on KVM, but it's not mandatory.
